# Skull Fit Adjuster

https://github.com/SinanGhimire/accessory-aligner-deluxe.git  on this repo this is what my previous replit said pls do it What's solid now: I found the real reason hats sit low and cover eyes — the old measurements included the hair, so gear was sized to the whole hairy silhouette instead of the actual skull. I now detect each character's skull (face shape only, hair excluded) frame by frame for standing, walking and dying, which gives an exact centre point and head width for every single frame. That fixes both the oversized look and the left/right drift. For the tumbling death frames I also have a reliable way to read how far the head is tilted, using the hair as the reference — that works for the blue, pink and gold-haired characters; the bald one has no hair to read, so his death frames stay upright. What's left: writing those measured values into the game's placement files, letting the death pose use its own values and tilt, and then eyeballing every character with a few different hats (cowboy, beanie, goggles, wizard) to confirm nothing covers the eyes. Nothing in your project has been changed yet, so the game still behaves exactly as before. Ping me when you've got credits again and I'll finish it in one pass. if this one is empty scaffold edit this in https://github.com/SinanGhimire/accessory-aligner      this one

## Development

Prefer working locally? You need Node.js and npm — [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

```sh
git clone <this-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Running Echo Vanguards on Android

1. Export the project to GitHub and `git pull` it locally, then run `npm install`.
2. `npx cap add android` (one time) — this creates the native Android project.
3. `npm run build` then `npx cap sync android`.
4. `npx cap run android` with Android Studio installed, or open the `android/`
   folder in Android Studio and build a signed APK / AAB for the Play Store.

`capacitor.config.ts` points the app at the live preview URL so the phone always
loads the latest build. Delete the `server` block before shipping to the store so
the APK runs entirely from the bundled `dist/` output.
